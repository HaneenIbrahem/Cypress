Please note: You will need to replace the placeholder values `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPEECH_API_KEY`, `SMART_HOME_API_ENDPOINT`, and `device_id_*` with your actual keys and device IDs in order to make this example work properly. It's also important to handle API rate limits, handle permissions and access tokens, and improve error handling for security and robustness.

This code uses the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to recognize spoken commands. Once the command is recognized, it parses the transcript to identify the specified room name and desired action. The corresponding SMART device ID is retrieved based on the room name, and the action is executed on this device via RESTful APIs to change the lighting state or brightness level. If an error occurs during any stage, it will be logged and the process will be terminated.

Please replace the appropriate values and test this script carefully, making sure to adjust it as needed to suit your setup and requirements. Also, don't forget to secure your keys and store them securely instead of hard-coding them in the script. 

This is just an example, and it is strongly advised to handle voice commands on your server or instance and never give access to the APIs of your smart devices directly as these devices might be controlled by unauthorized persons which can be a serious security risk. For security reasons, be sure to follow best practices and handle tokens and device permissions accordingly.
